# Iris-Species-Classifier

This project focuses on classifying different species of iris flowers using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is the famous **Iris dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains information on the physical characteristics of irises belonging to three different species.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to predict the species of an iris flower based on its physical attributes.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Import the dataset and handle any missing or inconsistent data.
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the patterns and distributions in the data.
   
2. **Modeling**: 
   - Train machine learning models such as Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM) on the dataset.
   
3. **Evaluation**: 
   - Evaluate the performance of different models using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.

4. **Model Optimization**: 
   - Fine-tune the models for better performance using techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
